# Deep learning on cis-decoding with cistrome datasets 


## STRUCTURE 

(i). Training of TFs recognition patterns from cistrome datasets [on directory “1stDL_predict_CREs”] 

(ii). Deep learning for binary classification of expression patterns [on directory “2ndDL_predict_expression”] 

(iii). Feature visualization [on directory “Backpropagation”] 

 

 

### (i). Training of TFs recognition patterns from DAP-Seq 

1. Extract fragments including significant peak from DAP-Seq (NOTE: the length should be identical), to convert into simple text files. 
If you target 31-bp tiles, save as .txt like,
